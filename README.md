Hi, I’m Alejandro Palacio Caro, an undergraduate student at Florida State University pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I focus on embedded systems, robotics, and hardware–software integration, with a passion for building practical solutions that combine low-level programming with real-world electronics.

I have experience working with microcontrollers (MSP432, Arduino, Raspberry Pi), motor drivers, encoders, low-level coding in Assembly and VHDL, and custom circuitry to build autonomous systems. My projects include developing software for line-following robots, implementing camera-based navigation with ROS 2, and creating real-time control systems using serial communication. I also enjoy programming in C++, Java, and Python for system design, automation, and application development.
