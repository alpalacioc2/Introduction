Hi, I’m Alejandro Palacio Caro, an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at Florida State University with a minor in Computer Science. I have experience in hardware design, embedded systems, autonomous robotics, and navigation algorithms.
I have hands-on experience with microcontrollers and their underlying architectures, including the MSP430 (16-bit RISC), MSP432 with ARM Cortex-M4F (32-bit RISC), Arduino with AVR (8-bit RISC), and Raspberry Pi with ARM Cortex-A (32/64-bit application-class). My background also includes working with motor drivers, encoders, assembly programming, VHDL, and custom circuitry for autonomous systems, as well as proficiency in core programming languages. My projects include developing line-following robots, implementing camera-based navigation with ROS 2, and designing real-time control systems using serial communication. In addition, I enjoy programming in C++, Java, and Python for system design, automation, and application development.
